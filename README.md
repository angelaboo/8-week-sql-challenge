# 8-Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the **[8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**. Each case study offers a structured approach to testing and improving SQL skillsâ€”from basic queries to advanced data analysis techniquesâ€”through scenario-based exercises.

As I complete each challenge, I'll update this repository with my solutions, insights, and learnings. Stay tuned for more!
