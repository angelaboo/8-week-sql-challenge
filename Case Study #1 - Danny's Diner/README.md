# Case Study #1: Danny's Diner

## Overview
This repository contains my solution to **Case Study #1: Danny's Diner**, part of the **[8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**. This case study aims to analyze customer preferences, spending patterns, and the impact of the loyalty program to help Danny's Diner make data-driven business decisions.

<br>

## Case Study Background
Danny, a passionate Japanese food enthusiast, opened "Dannyâ€™s Diner" in early 2021, specializing in sushi, curry, and ramen. To keep the restaurant thriving, he needs help analyzing basic operational data collected over the past few months.

<br>

## Problem Statement
Danny aims to use the data to understand customer visiting patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. These insights will help enhance customer experiences and decide whether to expand the loyalty program. He also needs assistance in creating user-friendly datasets for his team to analyze without SQL.

## Key Questions Answered
The case study focuses on answering the following business questions using SQL queries:

- What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
- How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
- What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
- What is the most purchased item on the menu, and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
- Which item was the most popular for each customer?
- Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
- Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
- What is the total number of items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
- If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier, how many points would each customer have?
- In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date), they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi. How many points do customers A and B have at the end of January?

<br>

## Key Insights
- **Ramen is the Most Popular Item**: Ramen was the most frequently purchased item across all customers.
- **Varied Preferences**: While some customers exclusively ordered ramen, others explored multiple menu items.
- **Loyalty Program Drives Engagement**: Members of the loyalty program placed more orders and spent more on average compared to non-members.
- **First Week Incentive**: Customers tend to spend more in the first week after joining the loyalty program, likely due to the 2x points incentive.

<br>

## Recommendations
- **Menu Optimization**: Highlight ramen as the restaurant's signature dish and consider introducing new items based on customer preferences.
- **Promote Loyalty Program**: Encourage non-members to join by promoting the benefits, such as earning 2x points in the first week.
- **Continue 2x Points Offer**: Maintain the 2x points incentive in the first week after joining to encourage higher spending and increase customer engagement.
- **Personalized Offers**: Use customer segmentation to create tailored marketing strategies and personalized offers.
